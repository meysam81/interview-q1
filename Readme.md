# Question 1
There is an equation:

![a^4+b^4+c^4=d^4](.Readme_Images/a4.png)

The code in `main.cpp` will find all values matches this eqation for 1<a<100000,1<b<300000,1<c<500000,1<d<500000.

Please optimize this code.

If you do multiply optimization please consider to use different commit with complete explanation.

for test you code use this values:

    a = 95800 
	b = 217519 
	c = 414560 
	d = 422481
